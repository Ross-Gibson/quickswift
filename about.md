When I code I'm always having to use the internet. I know roughly what I'm trying to achieve, but there's always that thing I did a while back, or that code I know I have in another project that's hard to recall on the spot. That's why I've made this website.

I intend for this website to provide quick answers. Blogs and tutorials are great for learning new concepts and features, but when you kind of know what you're doing all you want is the code.

I'll attempt to keep posts on this website as small as possible and straight to the point. I'll also try my best to keep each post similar in format, with the goal of making content quick and easy to spot.

This is a side project to a [side project](http://sketchmateapp.com/ "Sketch Mate App"), so if you find mistakes or would like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Ross-Gibson/quickswift "Quick Swift Tips on GitHub").
